Purpose of engine was to hold shared hosting website,forum,pages and also in 
same time keep running on same database gamerludus present project but it holds newer version of cms and same as this one is not finished due to private reasons.


#History of project

The cms was created after finishing php,mysql certification in courses after half year go on them,to create it took about 6 months or something about that time due private reasons,
project moved on to gamerludus after big issues in personal life but passion really didn't left me so i decided to keep legacy alive but in the end project died and got resurrected from ashes.
